**Welcome!**

This is the landing page for demos, and example code written for [htm.java](https://github.com/numenta/htm.java).

**htm.java** is the official Java port of the Numenta Platform for Intelligent Computing [(NuPIC)](https://github.com/numenta/nupic). It is totally community driven (by people like yourself), and thrives due to the efforts of those willing to donate their free time to supporting what they feel is an important technology.

_Demo files and example programs can be downloaded from their respective directories here, for now they are not on a maven central repo as is htm.java._

You can come have a chat with everybody here:

***

Originally these examples resided in the htm.java repository and were transitioned to this location because they were making the core htm.java project a bit unwieldy as they grew in size. So we created a new repository so that htm.java could be leaner, meaner and easier to include in your projects.

***

In this repository you will find everything from example code snippets to full fledged demos with complex Graphical User Interfaces. Here's a list of the code that can be found here as of this writing:

* [Breaking News Demo](https://github.com/numenta/htm.java-examples/tree/master/src/main/java/org/numenta/nupic/examples/cortical_io/breakingnews)
* [Fox Eats Demo](https://github.com/numenta/htm.java-examples/tree/master/src/main/java/org/numenta/nupic/examples/cortical_io/foxeats)
* [Hot Gym Demo](https://github.com/numenta/htm.java-examples/tree/master/src/main/java/org/numenta/nupic/examples/napi/hotgym)
* [Quick Test](https://github.com/numenta/htm.java-examples/tree/master/src/main/java/org/numenta/nupic/examples/qt) - A look at how to piece together individual algorithms without using the Network API (For more information on getting the Network API up and running quickly, see: [NAPI](https://github.com/numenta/htm.java/wiki/NAPI-Quick-Start-Guide))
* [SP Example](https://github.com/numenta/htm.java-examples/tree/master/src/main/java/org/numenta/nupic/examples/sp)
